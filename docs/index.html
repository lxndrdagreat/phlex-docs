<h1>Phlex</h1>
<p>Thanks for your interesting in Phlex! This documentation is in the very early
stages, so please be patient while it is being worked on.</p>
<p>For now, check out the repo <a href="https://github.com/lxndrdagreat/phlex">here</a>.</p>
<h2>What is Phlex?</h2>
<p>Phlex is a tool that takes files and generates static HTML pages from them.</p>
<p><em>So... it's just another static site generator?</em></p>
<p>Yes; and no. There are lots of great tools out there for generating static
sites; many of them work similarly to Phlex.</p>
<p><em>Why make Phlex, then?</em></p>
<p>The biggest reason we made Phlex was to solve a single hurdle we were having:
<em><strong>getting data into our static HTML in a meaningfull way</strong></em>.</p>
<p>The tools that we were looking at focused at doing one thing exceptionally
well: take simple text (usually using Markdown) and make it look nice on
a page.</p>
<p>This was nice, but we needed a way to get sets of data onto a page with
as minimal effort as possible. We wanted to be able to do it as easily
as if you were writing a blog post in Markdown.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Written in Python, Phlex is a commandline tool that takes files, runs them
through a parser and template engine, and outputs them to a directory in
a structure that is similar to how they were found.</p>
<p><strong>Here is an example blog page:</strong></p>
<pre><code>==&gt;context
template: post
title: I started a blog about HTML
&lt;==context

# I started a blog about HTML

I will probably write this post and maybe one or two more posts, and then
I will forget to write posts for quite some time.

Then, after a few months of silence, I will write several more posts during
an extremely short amount of time.

Soon, my blog will go silent _once again_.
</code></pre>
<p>That is a very simple page, and you will probably notice its similarities to
other Markdown-based generators.</p>
<p>The information inside of the <code>context</code> block is some basic data, and everything
else outside of that block is our page's text, written in Markdown. The default
parser takes that file, turns everything inside the <code>context</code> block into data
via YAML, which can then be used by the Jinja template engine; the rest of the
page is rendered out using Markdown.</p>
<h2>Adding more data</h2>
<p>So far, Phlex hasn't done anything different. Now, let's look at an example
of more powerful data, using YAML inside of the <code>context</code> block.</p>
<p><strong>Our data file, called 'posts.yd'</strong></p>
<pre><code>==&gt;context
template: blog_roll
title: All of my posts
posts: datafrom=&gt;(posts)
&lt;==context
</code></pre>
<p>Notice something? We didn't even bother doing any Markdown text for the page's
body. Now, imagine that this blog about HTML was actually very active and has
a hundred (<em>or more!</em>) posts in a subfolder called "posts".</p>
<p><strong>Example project folder structure:</strong></p>
<pre><code>my-html-blog/
    index.yd
    posts.yd
    posts/
        post01.yd
        ...
        post101.yd
</code></pre>
<p>When Phlex goes to parse the <code>posts.yd</code> file, it will find the <code>datafrom</code>
command in the <code>context</code> block. It will do a search for the "posts" folder
and will collect the page data from the pages inside that folder, storing
that information as an array in the <code>posts</code> variable.</p>
<p>Then, the template engine could do something like the following:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;This is my blog about HTML!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Here are the posts I have written!&lt;/h2&gt;

{% for post in posts %}
    &lt;div class="post"&gt;
        &lt;a href="{{ post.href }}"&gt;{{ post.title }}&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
{% endfor %}
</code></pre>
